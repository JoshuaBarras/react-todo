# React Todo App

React Todo App using React Hooks and AirBnB's ESLint config

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed and are using at least Node.js `v14.8`

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JoshuaBarras/react-todo.git
cd react-todo
```

If you have `nvm` installed you can use the following to install and use the same version I developed with

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

Use the following to install the dependencies and run the app

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

## Todo

Ideally when I have more time I'd like to:
- [ ] Add unit testing
